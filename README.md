# Koreo

# Read Me

Koreo was created for Riordan students to choose their classes. Koreo makes it easier for the administration and the students keep track of class selection. Students can also see which teachers are teaching a class but not specifically which block a teacher is teaching. Koreo is meant to streamline old ways of choosing classes.
