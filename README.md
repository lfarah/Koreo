# Koreo

# About

Koreo was created for Riordan students to choose their classes. Koreo makes it easier for the administration and the students keep track of class selection. Students can also see which teachers are teaching a class but not specifically which block a teacher is teaching. Koreo is meant to streamline old ways of choosing classes. 

### Challenges

- learning Python and Flask
- Collection views
- pulling data from server to app
- Managing navigation controller
- Photoshoping app logo

### What We Used

1. Python with Flask - Backend
2. iOS with Xcode and Swift - App
3. Alamofire - Networking
4. Swiftlint - Linting the Swift code

### How to use Koreo

1. Select required and choose specific required courses
2. Then select electives and choose which electives you want

### Making Koreo

Server reads a class json and returns files based on what was called. We built this server using Flask. Ronan learned Python and Flask for this project using CodeAcademy. We built the frontend of the app that contains all the user interactions. We created viewcontrollers that when clicked change to the area desired. We created the collectionView and other tableViews that contain the data that will show up in the app.
